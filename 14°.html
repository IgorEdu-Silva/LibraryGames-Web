                <p>
                    You look at the case files strewn across your desk, the green lamp illuminating the coffee stains that disfigure the
                    wood. The radio plays the news quietly in the background. The Peterson Family… missing for over a week; no trace, little
                    evidence. Passed from one detective to another, finally coming to rest in peace on your desk.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Going over the paperwork, something gnaws at you; people don’t just disappear into thin air. Something is always left
                    behind. We always leave something behind.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The radio picks up, yet another tale of little green men and flying saucers. You tell yourself it’s a load of baloney,
                    but truthfully it creeps you out as much as everyone else. Closing the case files, you pick up your hat and prepare
                    yourself. This afternoon you're going to The Peterson's home to conduct a final search. Your intention to find them…
                    dead or alive.
