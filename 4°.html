                <p>
                    Survival of the fittest - Each side is struggling to survive. Not only the bunnies need charge to survive, so does the
                    monster.
                    
                    Replayability - No two playthroughs are ever the same. To survive, you’ll need a trustworthy team and perfect execution.
                    
                    Multiplayer features - Make use of our in-game positional voice chat. Bring friends, or find other players using the
                    server browser.
                </p>
                
                <p>Point of View - All players play in first-person and nobody has the advantage of better situational awareness.</p>
                
                <p>
                    Circus is loud, circus has a crowd
                    Circus is fun, you’re never done
                    But now…
                    Circus is silent, Circus is violent.
                    No time for fun, you’ll need to run!
                </p>

                <strong>THE BUNNIES</strong><br>
                
                <p>
                    Objective - Bunnies’ goal in each match is not to get caught by the Carnival Monster and exhaust all of the wind-up
                    keys. Bunnies need to cooperate and survive till the Carnival Monster’s charge runs out.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Twist and turn - Players must wind each other up before the charge runs out but beware of the sound generated from the
                    charge-up.
                    The sound is so loud that it can alert the Carnival Monster of your location.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Wind-up Buddies - If you get caught by the Monster, you will lose your wind-up key and eventually run out of charge. But
                    other players can share their wind-up keys with you or you can loot the limited number of wind-up keys lying around the
                    map.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Play Possum - There are procedurally generated groups of dead bunnies that can be found all over the map and you can
                    play dead to hide among them.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The Lazarus - Out of charge does not mean you are dead. Other players can use their own keys or loot an additional key
                    to charge you back up.
                </p>

                <p>Helping Hand - Players can help each other to achieve certain objectives which are not possible to do alone.</p>

                <strong>THE CARNIVAL MONSTERS</strong><br>
                
                <p>
                    The Monsters - Each carnival monster has it's own unique set of skills to perform.
                    
                    The Magician - He simply performs walking and jogging actions, but bear in mind that he is a magician by day.
                    
                    
                    
                    The Hunt - You need to capture the bunnies and consume their wind-up keys to charge yourself up and keep hunting for
                    more.
                    
                    Eyeball - In a situation where bunnies acting as if they are dead, the magician checks to see if it is an actual dead
                    rabbit or a player pretending to be one. You can check all of them but you will lose precious time doing so.
                </p>
